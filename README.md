What is Car Game
=============
Car Games is a game design for Android devices. This game’s main goal is parking 8 car almost “simultaneously”. Time is not linear for player. To explain it better;
-	Player plays first car and game is collects car’s actions.
-	Then, player’s control passes the next car. Previous car is start playing by PC with collected data.
-	This loop will continued until last car(default 8.) is finished.

Levels
=============
One of the assignment was “A new level has to be created from the editor, without writing any code.” Accordingly, Car Game’s levels can created only with Unity’s Editor. While performing this process, I got help from the “prefabs”.
